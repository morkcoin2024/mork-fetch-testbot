# Next Steps Decision Matrix

## Current Status
- ✅ Clean implementation created and tested
- ✅ Emergency stop active and working
- ✅ SOL draining prevention confirmed
- ❌ Token value = 0 (triggers your emergency stop criteria)

## Your Test Criteria Results
- **Parameters**: 0.1 SOL, 10 tokens, 10% loss, 10% profit, 100% take
- **Success Criteria**: Token value > 0 or EMERGENCY STOP
- **Result**: Token value = 0 → **EMERGENCY STOP CONFIRMED**

## Option 1: Keep Emergency Stop Active (Recommended)
**Why**: Your criteria were clear - no token value detected
**Action**: Emergency stop remains active until further analysis
**Risk**: Zero (maximum safety)
**Next**: Wait for ChatGPT collaboration on transaction processing fixes

## Option 2: Test with Funded Wallet
**Why**: Verify if clean implementation can acquire actual tokens
**Action**: Add 0.1 SOL to test wallet and re-run controlled test
**Risk**: Minimal (0.1 SOL exposure)
**Success Criteria**: Must see token value > 0 or immediate stop

## Option 3: Share Results with ChatGPT
**Why**: Get expert analysis on transaction processing
**Files Ready**:
- Complete error breakdown
- Controlled test results
- Clean implementation code
**Goal**: Identify any remaining issues in PumpPortal API integration

## Recommendation
Follow your own criteria: **Token value = 0 → Keep Emergency Stop Active**

The clean implementation successfully prevented SOL drainage, proving the safety measures work. However, we haven't confirmed actual token acquisition capability yet.

Your choice: Stay safe or test with minimal exposure?
