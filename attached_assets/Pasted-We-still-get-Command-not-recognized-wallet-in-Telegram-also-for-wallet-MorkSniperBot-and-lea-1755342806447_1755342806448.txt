We still get “❓ Command not recognized: /wallet” in Telegram (also for /wallet@MorkSniperBot and leading-space variant).

I need you to pinpoint WHY the router hits the unknown-command branch and give a one-line minimal fix if it’s comparing the wrong variable.

Please provide ONLY the following, in order (no extra commentary):

A) Show the exact unknown-command branch
- Paste ~20 lines around the code that emits:
  "❓ Command not recognized: {clean}\nUse /help for available commands."
- Identify exactly which variable the membership check uses (e.g., `if clean not in all_commands:` or `if cmd not in all_commands:`).
- State the values used in the check (e.g., leading slash? lowercased?).

B) Command list construction proof
- Paste the lines where `all_commands` (and related lists/maps) are built.
- Confirm each entry format (leading slash + lowercase), and that "/wallet" is present.
- Provide a tiny snippet that prints these at runtime once (first 10 items) to logs for verification.

C) Temporary trace (minimal diff)
Provide a tiny git-style diff adding **temporary** debug lines inside the router just before the unknown-command check:
  print("[router] DBG", "clean=", repr(clean), "cmd=", repr(cmd),
        "in_all_clean=", (clean in all_commands),
        "in_all_cmd=", (cmd in all_commands))
No other changes.

D) Likely root cause & minimal fix
If the check compares `clean` (which may be "/wallet@MorkSniperBot") instead of `cmd` ("/wallet"), propose the one-line fix:
- change the membership test to use `cmd` (already normalized by `_parse_cmd`)
- ensure `cmd` is lowercased and starts with "/"
Provide the one-line git-style diff only.

E) Verification steps (I will run and paste logs)
- Foreground run:
  LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python3 -u simple_polling_bot.py
- Send in Telegram (private chat) in this order:
  1) /wallet
  2) /wallet@MorkSniperBot
  3)  ␠/wallet   (leading space)
- Expected healthy trace (you specify exact lines I should see), including:
  [router] DBG clean=..., cmd='/wallet', in_all_cmd=True
  Response sent: True

Constraints:
- Minimal change focused ONLY on the unknown-command membership check.
- No refactors. Don’t touch dedupe/networking.
