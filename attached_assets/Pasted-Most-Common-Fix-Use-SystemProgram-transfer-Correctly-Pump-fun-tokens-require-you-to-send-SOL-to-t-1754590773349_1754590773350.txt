Most Common Fix: Use SystemProgram.transfer() Correctly
Pump.fun tokens require you to send SOL to the token‚Äôs unique bonding address.

This must come directly from the burner wallet, signed and sent like this:

‚úÖ Minimal Working Code (Paste This):
python
Copy
Edit
from solana.transaction import Transaction
from solana.system_program import TransferParams, transfer

tx = Transaction()
tx.add(
    transfer(
        TransferParams(
            from_pubkey=burner_wallet.public_key,  # burner wallet
            to_pubkey=bonding_contract_pubkey,     # pump.fun bonding address
            lamports=int(0.1 * 1e9),               # 0.1 SOL
        )
    )
)

response = client.send_transaction(tx, burner_wallet)
print(response)
‚úîÔ∏è Check that:

bonding_contract_pubkey is correct (each token on Pump.fun has a unique one)

burner_wallet is properly loaded from secret key

You‚Äôre using client.send_transaction(..., burner_wallet), not a Phantom key

‚úÖ 2. Debug What‚Äôs Being Signed and Sent
Ask your Replit assistant to print this before sending:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Burner public key:", burner_wallet.public_key)
print("Bonding contract address:", bonding_contract_pubkey)
print("Amount in lamports:", int(amount * 1e9))
If the wallet address isn‚Äôt correct, or the amount is zero, TX won‚Äôt go through.

‚úÖ 3. Ensure Burner Wallet Has Sufficient Funds
Even if it looks funded, double-check right before TX:

python
Copy
Edit
balance = client.get_balance(burner_wallet.public_key)['result']['value']
if balance < int(amount * 1e9):
    print("Insufficient funds in burner wallet")
    return
If it's even 1 lamport short, the transaction fails silently.

üß† Additional Checks to Tell Your Assistant
Ask them to confirm:

üî≤ burner_wallet is loaded as a Keypair, not just public key
python
Copy
Edit
from solana.keypair import Keypair
burner_wallet = Keypair.from_secret_key(secret_key_bytes)
üî≤ They're using send_transaction() and not raw request_airdrop() or similar
üî≤ They're not accidentally trying to use Phantom wallet to sign instead of burner
üí• TL;DR to Give Your Replit Assistant
‚ÄúPlease ensure the bot is using the SystemProgram.transfer() method to send SOL from the burner wallet directly to the token‚Äôs bonding contract address. It must be signed using the burner Keypair, and we should check that the burner has enough SOL before attempting the TX. Print the public key, contract address, and amount just before sending for debugging.‚Äù
