WHAT IS MORK SNIPER BOT?
Mork Sniper Bot is a Telegram-based crypto bot that runs on Replit using Python. It helps users buy (or simulate buying) tokens on the Solana blockchain, especially those launched on Pump.fun, a platform for launching meme coins.

There are two modes:
🧪 1. FREE (Simulation/Test Mode)
Anyone can try this version. It simulates the sniping experience without requiring tokens or wallets.

What users can do:

Run /snipe to test what the bot does.

Enter token contract address

Enter stop-loss, take-profit, and sell % settings

Hit /confirm to simulate the trade

✅ Purpose: Show users how the bot works without real risk.

💰 2. PAID (Live Sniping Mode)
This is the real deal — only available to users who hold at least 100,000 $MORK tokens in their Phantom wallet.

What users will be able to do:

Link their Phantom Wallet

Bot checks if they hold ≥100,000 $MORK

Once verified, they unlock access to:

/fetch: Start a real snipe

Bot asks for token contract

Then asks:

How much SOL to spend (e.g. 1 SOL)

Stop-loss %

Take-profit %

What % of tokens to sell

Then /confirm begins monitoring or executing trades via Solana DEXs

Optional advanced logic:

Auto-sell if token hits Raydium

Risk filters (LP, volume, bonding curve)

Meme coin strategy scanner

⚙️ WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES?
The bot handles:

User input flow (wallet → token → risk parameters)

MORK token balance check via Phantom wallet scan

Simulated trades for test users

Real trade triggers via Pump.fun/DEX once confirmed

Stop-loss/Take-profit logic (sell if thresholds are hit)

In later phases:

The bot will scan Pump.fun live for new meme coin launches

It will suggest potential snipes based on hype, volume, LP, social buzz, etc.

Users can opt into auto-buy if it fits their chosen risk profile

🔒 WHY IS MORK TOKEN REQUIRED?
Holding $MORK is the entry pass to use the premium features.

It's wallet-based access control

Verified via Phantom wallet scan

No $MORK = only test mode

🧠 LONG-TERM VISION
Mork Bot becomes:

A fully autonomous meme coin trading assistant

Suggests trending tokens and executes real trades

Built-in scam filters, profit optimization, and wallet stats

Possibly integrated with Raydium and Jupiter APIs for actual trade routing

Expands into a real utility bot for degen Solana traders

Ready to build now?
If that makes sense to you, I’ll:

Start by coding just the FREE MODE (fully working simulation flow)

Then add wallet linking and $MORK balance check

Then add Pump.fun scanner + live trade logic

Let me know if we’re 100% clear, or if you want to tweak/add anything before we code.

Perfect, i will create a new project on replit now and give you the details.

Excellent — once you’ve created the new project on Replit, just drop the following here:

✅ Your new Replit project name

🌐 Your Replit domain link (e.g. https://mork-sniper-bot.replit.app)

🔑 Bot token from BotFather (just for dev use — we can swap later for security)

As soon as I have those, I’ll:

Set up the full main.py with Flask + Telegram bot webhook support

Configure environment variables and .replit settings for Replit deployment

Begin building the FREE SIMULATION MODE flow (/start → /snipe → /confirm)

Guide you step-by-step with zero guesswork
