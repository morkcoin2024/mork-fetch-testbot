Existing Bots & Tooling
Open‑Source Sniper Bots
There are several community-built bots designed to automatically monitor Pump.fun mints and execute trades:

A Go-based sniper bot by 1fge/pump-fun-sniper-bot that listens to Solana's WebSocket stream, detects new mints, and handles buy/sell execution.

A TypeScript bot (carson2222/pumpfun-bot) leveraging Anchor and Solana Web3.js, built for speed (though still somewhat experimental).

Chainstack’s Learning Suite
The Chainstack “pump‑fun‑bot” repository provides Python reference code—including listener, buy, and sell scripts—to detect Pump.fun mints and even migrations.

Comprehensive Development Tutorial
Chainstack's guide covers how to monitor Pump.fun's on-chain program directly using Anchor IDLs, decode transactions, and automate token snipes and sales.

Detecting Migrated Tokens (Pump.fun → Raydium)
If you're aiming to catch tokens right as they push into liquidity pools on Raydium — especially those with contracts or names ending in “pump” — here’s what you can do:

Monitor Raydium’s Migration Contract
Tokens that finish bonding on Pump.fun and get added to Raydium can be tracked by listening for the initialize2 instruction on a specific Raydium program. This method gives you both the token mint and Raydium pool address in near real-time.

Alternative: Use an API for Token Data
For data and programmatic access, consider using Moralis' Pump.fun API:

Fetch token prices, bonding status, swaps, metadata, and more—including bonded and pre-bonded stages.

It supports streamlining token detection and monitoring without needing to handle low-level on-chain logic manually.

This can significantly simplify building dashboards or alert systems tied to Pump.fun token events.

TL;DR Summary
Goal	Available Tool/Approach
Auto-sniping Pump.fun tokens	Use open-source bots (1fge, carson2222) or Chainstack Python examples
Detect migration to Raydium	Listen to Raydium contract initialize2 filters for migration events
Fetch real-time token data	Use Moralis Pump.fun API for high-level access to bonding status and trades
