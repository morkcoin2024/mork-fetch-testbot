We’re still seeing in Telegram:
- /ping ✅
- /autosell_status ✅
- /wallet ❌ “Command not recognized: /wallet (Use /help)”

This is not a silent swallow — the router is replying “not recognized”. Please reconcile that with your earlier “duplicate message detection” diagnosis.

Give me ONLY the following, in order:

1) Reconcilement (brief):
   - Explain how a dedupe bug could produce a “not recognized” reply vs returning an empty response.
   - If these are different failure modes, say which one we have now and why.

2) Exact diffs you say you applied:
   - Unified diff (git-style) for app.py where _webhook_is_dup_message() changed.
   - No pseudo, real patch. If no patch actually applied, say so.

3) Command registration proof:
   - Print the list of registered commands and which bucket they’re in.
   - Show the exact conditional that matches /wallet in the router.
   - Show how /help builds its command list.
   - Commands to run and the outputs (copy/paste):
     ```
     grep -n -A 40 "def process_telegram_command" app.py
     grep -n -A 20 -E "all_commands|public_commands|admin_commands|command_map" app.py
     grep -n -A 12 'cmd == "/wallet"' app.py
     grep -n -A 12 'cmd == "/autosell' app.py
     ```

4) Runtime evidence from the live bot (not direct invocation):
   - Show log lines when I send /wallet vs /autosell_status in Telegram:
     ```
     tail -n 400 polling_bot*.log | grep -n -E "(wallet|autosell_status|Command not recognized|router)"
     ```
   - If there is a “not recognized” path, include the code that emits that exact string.

5) Minimal fix proposal (if registration is the issue):
   - Provide a minimal diff that ensures /wallet routes correctly (no refactors).
   - Include a 2-step verification:
     - `pytest -q` (if we have tests) or a tiny REPL proof for /wallet
     - A log snippet after sending /wallet in Telegram that shows the handler firing.

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal, focused on /wallet routing only.
- Don’t modify dedupe logic again unless you can show logs that dedupe is the cause of THIS “not recognized” reply.
