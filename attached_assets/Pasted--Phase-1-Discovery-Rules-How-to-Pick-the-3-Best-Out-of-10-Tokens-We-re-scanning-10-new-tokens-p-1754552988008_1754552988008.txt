🧠 Phase 1: Discovery Rules – How to Pick the 3 Best Out of 10 Tokens
We’re scanning 10 new tokens per batch. Our goal: isolate the ones with serious upside and dodge the rugs, honeypots, and fluff.

✅ Selection Criteria for Winners:
Name/Meme Power

Strong meme value (e.g., “ZUCKED,” “SIMP3000,” “BILL GATES BACKDOOR”)

Pop culture tie-ins or trend jacks

Easy to shill, pronounce, or turn into memes.

Telegram Activity Within 10 Minutes of Launch

≥ 50 members in group within 5 minutes = high alpha

Devs answering questions = ✅

Pinned messages, memes, sticker packs ready = ✅

Initial Bonding Momentum

≥ 0.3 SOL bonded in < 3 minutes

3+ unique buyers (not all one wallet)

No instant 100% sell = indicates real community building

Dev Doxxing or Social Proof

Dev Twitter/X account with history

Telegram bio links to past legit projects

Group description includes roadmap / values / DEX migration intent

Migration Signals (Off-Ramp Planning)

Mentions of Raydium, Jupiter, or LP setup

“We will launch LP soon” or “DEX at 20 SOL” = higher quality

Wallet Health

Creator wallet has activity history, not brand new

Creator is not a serial rugger on Solana (can be checked)

🔐 Phase 2: Risk Management Rules – How Not to Get Rekt
You’ve picked the 3 best. Here’s how you minimize downside and maximize upside:

📉 Risk Controls per Trade:
Entry Timing

Never enter before 0.3–0.5 SOL bonded (avoid illiquid rugs)

Ideal: 0.8–2.0 SOL range — still early, but confirmed traction

Wallet Spread

Don’t go all-in. Use 3 separate Phantom wallets for entry

3x 1 SOL is better than 1x 3 SOL = exit flexibility + rug insulation

Stop-Loss

Auto-sell at -40% if momentum stalls for 3m

Exception: Known dev with migration plan? Hold longer.

Take-Profit Strategy

Take 30–50% profits at 2x (early exit liquidity)

Trail stop remaining with +100% trailing margin (e.g. 4x → sell if drops to 3x)

Anti-Rug Filter

Pull funds from wallet instantly if:

Dev removes group link

Creator wallet dumps more than 30%

Telegram pinned message deleted

Daily Max Exposure

Max 10% of trading bankroll per day

3.33% per token × 3 tokens = optimal risk distribution

📈 Phase 3: Scaling and Alpha Capture
🧪 Post-Investment Monitoring:
Twitter Mentions Tracker

Monitor $TOKEN cashtags on X

Volume spikes = exit signal (often precedes dump)

Pump.fun Leaderboard Rank

If token enters Top 20: raise stop-loss to -20%

If token hits Top 10: consider full exit or 70% profit lock

DEX Migration Confirmed?

Pull LP status from Solana / Raydium

Token goes live on DEX? Rebuy at pullback.

🧬 Automation Rules for Bot Version (F.E.T.C.H)
If we plug this into a bot:

Auto-scan latest Pump.fun contracts

Apply meme filter, social signal analysis, bonding metrics

Filter Top 3: Auto-tag tokens for manual review or buy

Execute buys via burner Phantom wallets

Monitor TG + price movement via bot hooks

Set auto stop-loss and take-profit thresholds

Notify trader via Telegram on key trigger events

🥩 Summary (Degenerate Edition):
Only buy what looks like it could get posted on X/Twitter by a thousand bored anons at once.
Never ape in blind. Let other idiots test the water.
Shillability > Tech. Liquidity > Hope. Risk mgmt > Ego.
