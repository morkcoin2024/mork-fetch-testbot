# CRITICAL BUG: Jupiter Trading Engine False Success Reports

## Issue
Jupiter trading engine reports successful trades with fake transaction hashes when actual blockchain transactions fail.

## Evidence
- Claimed transaction: 4AD52bopKsa9a26hsJF5296UQM67yPmJ8FNnLPaMavXkc1USU52sC3eAytJqmW1gdSRbyY85nCYNEko7UoynxpES
- **Transaction does not exist on Solana blockchain**
- Reported 1,752 new DEGEN tokens but user's wallet unchanged
- System reads existing token balances and reports as new purchases

## Root Cause
Jupiter transaction broadcasting fails silently, but verification step continues and reads existing wallet balances.

## Impact
- FALSE SUCCESS REPORTING
- Users believe trades executed when they didn't
- Potential financial confusion and loss tracking
- System reliability completely compromised

## Status
EMERGENCY - All Jupiter trading must be disabled until fix is implemented.

## User Notification
User correctly identified no new tokens in wallet despite "successful" trade report.
