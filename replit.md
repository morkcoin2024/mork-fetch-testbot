# Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot

## Overview

Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot, "The Degens' Best Friend," is a production-ready Telegram-based cryptocurrency trading bot for Solana blockchain tokens, specifically those on Pump.fun. Its purpose is to enable fast execution and control over trades. Key capabilities include secure wallet management, Jupiter DEX integration, comprehensive safety checks, and MORK holder access gates. The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, automated trading solution for Solana degens, enhancing their trading efficiency and profitability.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework Architecture
The application utilizes Flask with a webhook-based architecture for Telegram integration. `app.py` handles Flask configuration, session management, database connectivity, and webhook processing. Bot logic in `bot.py` processes Telegram updates.

### Database Architecture
SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask-SQLAlchemy manages data persistence. `UserSession` stores conversation states and trading parameters, while `TradeSimulation` records simulation history. SQLite is default, with environment-variable support for other databases.

### State Management System
A finite state machine manages multi-step user interactions, including states for contract address input, financial parameters (stop-loss/take-profit/sell percentage), and confirmation. This ensures consistent user experience and data integrity.

### Message Processing Architecture
Telegram webhook updates are routed based on user state and commands. Session persistence is maintained to facilitate multi-step trading parameter collection.

### Trading Modes Architecture
The system supports three distinct trading modes:
- **Simulation mode**: Risk-free testing of strategies.
- **Manual live trading mode (`/snipe`)**: Direct token purchasing requiring user confirmation and 0.1 SOL worth of $MORK.
- **Automated VIP trading mode (`/fetch`)**: Fully automated token discovery and trading, requiring 1 SOL worth of $MORK.
- **Trading Engine**: Utilizes PumpPortal Lightning Transaction API for verified token delivery.

### UI/UX Decisions
The bot adopts Mork Coin's branding guidelines, using green primary and light green accent colors. Text styling follows specific color rules for brand consistency. Playful, dog-themed messaging and meme-friendly language cater to the target crypto audience.

### Technical Implementations
- **AI Assistant**: A comprehensive AI assistant system with Flask webhook integration and dynamic model management. Features include `assistant_dev.py` for code generation, `assistant_generate_sync()` for webhook compatibility, and `/assistant_model` commands for real-time model switching. The system supports multiple AI models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-5-Thinking) with intelligent fallback (preferred model â†’ gpt-4o on failure). Persistent model storage via `.assistant_model` file enables selection persistence across restarts. Admin-only access with comprehensive security controls. Flask webhook integration provides synchronous AI assistance without async complications.
- **Enhanced Tri-Source Token Engine**: A comprehensive tri-source token filtering and scoring architecture with real-time blockchain monitoring. Features include enhanced `data_fetcher.py` with tri-source integration (On-chain + Pump.fun + DexScreener), intelligent on-chain watcher via `pump_chain.py` for real-time Solana blockchain monitoring, source-aware deduplication with priority hierarchy (pumpfun-chain > pumpfun > dexscreener), advanced risk scoring with renounced authority bonuses, smart ranking algorithm (source â†’ risk â†’ liquidity), production-grade error handling with graceful fallback, flexible JSON parsing supporting multiple API formats, timestamp normalization, enhanced metadata extraction, source tagging (ðŸ”— On-chain, ðŸŸ¢ Pump.fun, ðŸ”µ DexScreener), and the comprehensive `fetch_and_rank()` function for unified tri-source data processing. Real-time configuration management via Telegram commands with Flask webhook integration providing synchronous multi-source data processing and enterprise-grade reliability.
- **Telegram Integration**: Robust PTB v20+ integration with `ApplicationBuilder` pattern, webhook cleanup, group-based priority, graceful Flask fallback for PTB import conflicts, and comprehensive async admin monitoring commands (`/status`, `/logs_tail`, `/logs_stream`, `/logs_watch`, `/mode`) with admin alias variants (`/a_status`, `/a_logs_tail`, etc.) for legacy collision avoidance. Features real-time log capture, pattern-based alerting, enhanced file-based logging with rotation (1MB max, 3 backups), efficient async admin monitoring system with 4KB block file reading, task-based streaming, high-priority admin router with ApplicationHandlerStop support, multiple deployment patterns (CommandHandler, manual routing, text handler), and complete fallback compatibility for maximum deployment flexibility.
- **Enhanced Logging System**: Comprehensive dual-layer logging with `robust_logging.py` providing RotatingFileHandler (1MB max, 3 backups) and RingBufferHandler (12,000 line capacity). Features ultra-fast `/a_logs_tail` with ring buffer access, advanced argument parsing (`/a_logs_tail [n] [level=error|warn|info|all]`), intelligent level filtering, and hybrid file + ring buffer fallback for maximum reliability. Integration includes `_read_ring_tail()` helper in `alerts/telegram.py` for PTB compatibility and `_read_tail_file()` for timestamped file access with comprehensive error handling.
- **Enhanced Multi-Source Diagnostics**: Complete diagnostic system with `cmd_a_diag_fetch` providing live module reloading, comprehensive version tracking (alerts.telegram=tg-4, data_fetcher=df-4), real-time endpoint monitoring, and enhanced debugging capabilities. Features `/fetch_source pumpfun|dexscreener` for multi-source testing, DexScreener search API integration with proper search endpoint (`https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search`), intelligent retry logic with httpx, and production-grade diagnostic variable tracking with `LAST_JSON_URL/STATUS` monitoring.

## External Dependencies
