# Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot

## Overview
Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot, "The Degens' Best Friend," is a production-ready Telegram-based cryptocurrency trading bot for Solana blockchain tokens, specifically those on Pump.fun. Its purpose is to enable fast execution and control over trades. Key capabilities include secure wallet management, Jupiter DEX integration, comprehensive safety checks, and MORK holder access gates. The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, automated trading solution for Solana degens, enhancing their trading efficiency and profitability.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture
The application uses Flask with a webhook-based architecture for Telegram integration, managing session states and database persistence with SQLAlchemy. A finite state machine handles multi-step user interactions for consistent experience. The system supports Simulation, Manual Live Trading (`/snipe`), and Automated VIP Trading (`/fetch`) modes. UI/UX aligns with Mork Coin branding.

**Current Configuration: Multi-Source Token Discovery + Unified Single-Process Architecture (August 12, 2025)**
- **Birdeye HTTP Scanner**: Operational at 8-second intervals with API key 37c50ab5a1ac451980a1998b1c05fbf6
- **Jupiter Scanner**: Fully integrated and operational, fetching 287K+ tokens from https://token.jup.ag/all?includeCommunity=true
- **Solscan Pro Scanner**: **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Production-ready implementation with multi-endpoint support, safe header handling, retry logic. Status reporting bug fixed August 12, 2025 - now correctly displays "Solscan: ON" when API key is present. **404 errors completely resolved August 12, 2025**: Updated to working Solscan Pro API v2.0 endpoints, primary endpoint `/v2.0/token/trending` successfully returning 20 items per tick. **Enhanced logging integration completed**: normalized logging to root logger for `/a_logs_tail` visibility, enhanced heartbeat logging with base_url and keylen, manual `/solscan_ping` command for immediate testing, improved `/solscanstats` with detailed metrics (base_url, timestamps, request counts, last_status). **New Tokens Support with Robust Fallbacks (August 12, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive mode system with SOLSCAN_MODE âˆˆ {auto, new, trending} and ordered endpoint probing for new token discovery. Auto mode (default) attempts 4 new token endpoints (/v2/token/new, /v1/token/new, /v1/market/new-tokens, /v1/market/tokens/new) in sequence, falling back to trending if all fail. Added `/solscan_mode` admin command for runtime mode switching and enhanced `/solscanstats` to show current mode and successful endpoint. Operates in same process as webhook handlers for unified access to SCANNERS registry
- **WebSocket**: Disabled via FEATURE_WS=off with DisabledWS class implementation 
- **Unified Process Architecture**: **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED** - Single-worker Gunicorn configuration ensures webhook handlers and scanner threads share the same process and SCANNERS dictionary, resolving process isolation issues
- **Enhanced Admin Commands**: All Telegram commands (/scan_status, /solscanstats, /a_logs_tail) now work correctly with unified process architecture providing real-time access to scanner states
- **Centralized Scanner Registry**: SCANNERS global dictionary provides unified management with scanners and webhooks in same process (PID 14357)
- **Single-Worker Configuration**: Gunicorn --workers 1 ensures webhook handlers and scanner threads operate in unified process space for seamless state sharing
- **Persistent Configuration**: start.sh and start_single_worker.sh scripts maintain single-worker setup permanently with command: `gunicorn -k gthread -w 1 --threads 1 --reload=false -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app`
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: `/whoami` and `/a_whoami` commands provide comprehensive process verification including PID, worker count, active threads, and SCANNERS registry status for post-restart validation
