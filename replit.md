## System Architecture

### Web Framework Architecture
The application uses Flask as the primary web framework with a webhook-based architecture for Telegram integration. The main application entry point (`app.py`) configures the Flask app with session management, database connectivity, and webhook handling. The bot logic is separated into a dedicated module (`bot.py`) that processes Telegram updates and manages user interactions.

### Database Architecture
The system uses SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask-SQLAlchemy extension for database operations. Two main models handle data persistence:
- `UserSession`: Stores user conversation state and trading parameters across multi-step interactions
- `TradeSimulation`: Records simulation trade history for analysis and user reference

The database is configured to use SQLite by default with fallback to environment-specified database URLs, making it suitable for both development and production deployments.

### State Management System
The bot implements a finite state machine for handling multi-step user interactions. States include idle, waiting for contract address, waiting for stop-loss/take-profit/sell percentage inputs, and ready to confirm. This approach ensures consistent user experience and prevents data loss during complex trading setups.

### Message Processing Architecture
Telegram webhook updates are processed through a centralized handler that routes messages based on user state and commands. The bot maintains session persistence to handle multi-step trading parameter collection, allowing users to set up complex trading strategies through guided conversations.

### Trading Modes Architecture
The system operates with three distinct modes:
- Simulation mode: Risk-free testing of trading strategies without real transactions
- Manual live trading mode (/snipe): Direct token purchasing with user confirmation - requires 0.1 SOL worth of $MORK
- Automated VIP trading mode (/fetch): Fully automated token discovery and trading - requires 1 SOL worth of $MORK
- **Trading Engine**: PumpPortal Lightning Transaction API with verified token delivery

## External Dependencies

### Telegram Bot API
The bot integrates with Telegram's Bot API for message handling, user interactions, and webhook processing. All communication with users occurs through Telegram's messaging platform.

### Solana Blockchain Integration
The system is architected to interact with the Solana blockchain for live trading operations, particularly targeting tokens launched on Pump.fun platform. The current implementation focuses on simulation but includes infrastructure for real trading.

### Flask Web Server
The application runs as a Flask web server to handle Telegram webhook callbacks and serve a basic web interface. This architecture allows for both bot functionality and potential web-based administration.

### Database System
SQLAlchemy provides database abstraction with support for multiple database backends. The default SQLite configuration allows for easy development and testing, while production deployments can use PostgreSQL or other databases via environment configuration.

### Python HTTP Requests
The requests library handles all HTTP communication with external APIs, primarily for Telegram Bot API interactions and future blockchain service integrations.
