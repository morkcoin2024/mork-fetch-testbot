The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, automated trading solution for Solana degens, enhancing their trading efficiency and profitability.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture
The application uses Flask with a polling-based architecture for Telegram integration, managing session states and database persistence with SQLAlchemy. A finite state machine handles multi-step user interactions. UI/UX aligns with Mork Coin branding. The system supports Simulation, Manual Live Trading (`/snipe`), and Automated VIP Trading (`/fetch`) modes.

**Core Architectural Decisions & Features:**

Features a comprehensive 18-command Telegram suite for rule management, persistence, and control, plus public `/price <mint>` command for real-time price lookups.
- **Watchlist Alert System:** Real-time price monitoring with configurable percent-change thresholds for generating alerts when token prices move significantly. Integrated with AutoSell tick evaluation for seamless monitoring alongside trading rules. Features 7-command admin suite: `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/watchlist`, `/watch_sens`, `/autosell_restore`, `/alerts_on`, and `/alerts_off`. Includes comprehensive state persistence with automatic save on all changes, configurable sensitivity (0.1%-100%), and toggle controls for muting/unmuting alerts while preserving watchlist data.
- **Paper Trade Ledger System:** Complete DRY-RUN trading ledger with position tracking, average cost calculation, and comprehensive P&L management. Features 11-command admin suite: `/paper_buy`, `/paper_sell`, `/ledger`, `/ledger_reset`, `/ledger_pnl`, `/paper_setprice`, `/paper_clearprice`, `/ledger_pnl_csv`, `/paper_auto_on`, `/paper_auto_off`, and `/paper_auto_status`. Integrated with AutoSell state persistence for cross-restart durability. Supports automatic price discovery, manual price specification, and mark-to-market valuation with unrealized P&L calculations. Advanced features include real-time portfolio valuation, per-position unrealized gains/losses, manual price overrides with cleanup management, structured CSV export for analysis and reporting, and automated paper trading on alert events with configurable trade quantities and safe demo mode operation.
- **Alert Routing System:** Real-time alert forwarding to specified Telegram groups or channels with advanced flood control and persistent configuration. Features comprehensive 18-command admin suite: `/alerts_chat_set <chat_id>`, `/alerts_chat_set_here` (auto-detects current chat), `/alerts_chat_clear`, `/alerts_chat_status`, `/alerts_test <message>`, `/alerts_min_move <percent>` (threshold filtering), `/alerts_rate <N_per_min>` (rate limiting), `/alerts_settings` (detailed status), `/alerts_mute <duration>` (temporary muting with flexible duration parsing), `/alerts_unmute` (immediate unmute), `/discord_set <webhook-url>` (configure Discord webhook), `/discord_clear` (remove Discord webhook), `/discord_test <message>` (test Discord delivery), `/digest_status` (digest configuration), `/digest_on` (enable daily digest), `/digest_off` (disable daily digest), `/digest_time <HH:MM>` (set digest delivery time in UTC), and `/digest_test [note]` (manual digest test).
