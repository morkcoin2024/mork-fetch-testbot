## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture
The application uses Flask with a robust single-poller architecture for Telegram integration, managing session states and database persistence with SQLAlchemy. A finite state machine handles multi-step user interactions. UI/UX aligns with Mork Coin branding. The system supports Simulation, Manual Live Trading (`/snipe`), and Automated VIP Trading (`/fetch`) modes.
