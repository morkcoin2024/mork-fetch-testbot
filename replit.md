# Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot

## Overview
Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot, "The Degens' Best Friend," is a production-ready Telegram-based cryptocurrency trading bot for Solana blockchain tokens, specifically those on Pump.fun. Its purpose is to enable fast execution and control over trades. Key capabilities include secure wallet management, Jupiter DEX integration, comprehensive safety checks, and MORK holder access gates. The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, automated trading solution for Solana degens, enhancing their trading efficiency and profitability.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture
The application uses Flask with a webhook-based architecture for Telegram integration, managing session states and database persistence with SQLAlchemy. A finite state machine handles multi-step user interactions for consistent experience. The system supports Simulation, Manual Live Trading (`/snipe`), and Automated VIP Trading (`/fetch`) modes. UI/UX aligns with Mork Coin branding.
