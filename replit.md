# Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot

## Overview

Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot, "The Degens' Best Friend," is a production-ready Telegram-based cryptocurrency trading bot for Solana blockchain tokens, specifically those on Pump.fun. Its purpose is to enable fast execution and control over trades. Key capabilities include secure wallet management, Jupiter DEX integration, comprehensive safety checks, and MORK holder access gates. The business vision is to provide a user-friendly, automated trading solution for Solana degens, enhancing their trading efficiency and profitability.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Brand colors: Mork Coin branding with green primary color (#7cb342) and light green accent (#9ccc65) to match current brand guidelines.
Branding rules: "Mork F.E.T.C.H Bot" text should be dark green (#1a2e0a) on light green backgrounds, all other text should be white unless they are headline text. The bot is positioned as "The Degens' Best Friend" with playful dog-themed messaging around "fetching" profits and "sniffing" trades. F.E.T.C.H. = Fast Execution, Trade Control Handler. Uses casual, meme-friendly language appealing to crypto degenerates while maintaining professionalism.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework Architecture
The application utilizes Flask with a webhook-based architecture for Telegram integration. `app.py` handles Flask configuration, session management, database connectivity, and webhook processing. Bot logic in `bot.py` processes Telegram updates.

### Database Architecture
SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask-SQLAlchemy manages data persistence. `UserSession` stores conversation states and trading parameters, while `TradeSimulation` records simulation history. SQLite is default, with environment-variable support for other databases.

### State Management System
A finite state machine manages multi-step user interactions, including states for contract address input, financial parameters (stop-loss/take-profit/sell percentage), and confirmation. This ensures consistent user experience and data integrity.

### Message Processing Architecture
Telegram webhook updates are routed based on user state and commands. Session persistence is maintained to facilitate multi-step trading parameter collection.

### Trading Modes Architecture
The system supports three distinct trading modes:
- **Simulation mode**: Risk-free testing of strategies.
- **Manual live trading mode (`/snipe`)**: Direct token purchasing requiring user confirmation and 0.1 SOL worth of $MORK.
- **Automated VIP trading mode (`/fetch`)**: Fully automated token discovery and trading, requiring 1 SOL worth of $MORK.
- **Trading Engine**: Utilizes PumpPortal Lightning Transaction API for verified token delivery.

### UI/UX Decisions
The bot adopts Mork Coin's branding guidelines, using green primary and light green accent colors. Text styling follows specific color rules for brand consistency. Playful, dog-themed messaging and meme-friendly language cater to the target crypto audience.
